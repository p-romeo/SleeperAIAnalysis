# Fantasy Scoring & Player Validation Fixes

## üö® **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### 1. **Player Validation Problem**
**Issue**: The AI was recommending players not currently on the user's roster.

**Root Cause**: The `_get_relevant_players` method was not properly filtering players to only include those on the roster.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `_get_relevant_players` to only include players from the actual roster
- Added explicit roster validation in the AI prompt
- Enhanced player data structure with injury status and fantasy positions

### 2. **Fantasy Scoring Integration**

**Root Cause**: Missing integration with fantasy scoring APIs and projection services.

**Fix Applied**:
- Created new `FantasyScoringService` class
- Integrated ESPN Fantasy API (free, no key required)
